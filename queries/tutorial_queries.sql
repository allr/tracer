--- Note: According to our experiments user NEVER EVER use cons !!! The
--- standard library has only one call to is.pairlist and no cons call. This
--- is also the case in the MLOC that we've anaalyzed. Thus we can mostly
--- safely assert that cons are allocated byt the evaluator for it's own needs
--- (i.e. mostly function calls)

--- Note: String buffers are mostly inexistant
--- Note: Since a commit has been lost the dead of the ecoop submission (i.e.
--- `rm` BEFORE commit but AFTER generating fig 8) I have to check all these counters

--- Slight variations of this query may give more categories. However S3
--- objects CAN'T be counted (as fas I know) and S4 objects are not accurate
--- (Since the object bit may be switched `on` or `off`)

--    Number of arguments

-- There are two different way to obtain this information. One of those contains a bias thus it will not be discussed here. The
-- other one is mostly accurate with the following restriction: All numbers are bounded by 255 (this is done on purpose to
-- avoid trace size explosion, i.e. they are store on a byte).
